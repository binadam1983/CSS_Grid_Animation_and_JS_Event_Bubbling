# CSS_Grid_Animation_and_JS_Event_Delegation

This repo uses the combination of following CSS and JS features to demonstrate a concept that can serve as a simple, but exciting page layout model/proto:

  > CSS Grid Animation using transition, columns and rows
  > JS Event Delegation
  > Uses Math.floor, modulo, and quotient to determine the row and the column of the element/box clicked

###### Note: The app may not behave as intended on Chrome for not support CSS grid animations, but would work perfectly fine on Firefox.
